# Compression By Huffman

this is a project from one of my project course concercing algorithms. The role of this project is to zip / unzip text file with an huffman tree. 


## How to run the Application
You need to run it in a Java Consol.
Before that, make sure that the .txt file that you want to zip is in the current folder of the project.
At the begining of the apps, you have two choices :
1) regular algorithm
2)semi-adaptative algorithm

if you select 1), you will have 2 choices :
1)encode a .txt file :  you need the .txt file and a dictionnary which refers to the frequency of the chars in the .txt file
2)decode a .dat file : you need the .dat compressed file and the dictionnary which represents the binary code of each chars

if you select 2), you will have 2 choices :
1) encode a .txt file : you need the .txt file
2) decode a .dat file : you need the .dat compressed file and the dictionnary which represents the binary code of each chars
